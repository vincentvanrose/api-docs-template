# api-docs-template

Reusable API documentation templates with examples, best practices, and style guides for technical writers.

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of templates and guidelines for creating clear, consistent API documentation. Whether you're documenting REST APIs, smart contract interfaces, or developer tools, these templates offer a starting point that you can adapt to your project's needs.

## What's Included

- **Endpoint Template** — A structured format for documenting individual API endpoints, including parameters, request/response examples, and error handling
- **Style Guide** — Conventions for voice, tone, formatting, and code samples
- **Quickstart Template** — A framework for getting-started guides that help developers make their first successful API call

## Who This Is For

- Technical writers creating API documentation from scratch
- Developers who need to document their own APIs
- Teams looking to standardize their documentation approach

## Using These Templates

1. Browse the templates in this repository
2. Copy the template that fits your needs
3. Replace the placeholder content with your actual API details
4. Adapt the structure as needed for your specific use case

The templates use Markdown formatting and are designed to work with most documentation platforms (GitHub Pages, ReadTheDocs, Docusaurus, GitBook, etc.).

## Template Philosophy

Good API documentation should be:

- **Scannable** — Developers often look for specific information rather than reading linearly. Use clear headings and consistent structure.
- **Example-driven** — Show, don't just tell. Every endpoint should include realistic request and response examples.
- **Copy-paste friendly** — Code samples should work when copied directly, with placeholder values clearly marked.
- **Error-aware** — Document what can go wrong, not just the happy path.
